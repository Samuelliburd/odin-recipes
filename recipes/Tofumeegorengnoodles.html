    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>An easy vegan fried noodle dish made with a sweet and aromatic syrupy soy sauce (ketjap manis) and with as much of a chilli kick as you dare!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 pak choi</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>140g/5oz extra firm tofu, drained well</li>
        <li>½ onion, cut into thin wedges</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz Tenderstem broccoli, stems sliced and heads halved if large, or ordinary broccoli cut into small florets</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, seeds removed, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
        <li>300g/9oz ready-cooked vegan noodles, such as no-egg medium noodles or rice noodles</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ketjap manis (thick soy sauce)</li>
        <li>½–1 tsp chilli paste or sauce, depending on taste</li>
        <li>25g/1oz roasted cashew nuts, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Trim the pak choi and cut into roughly 3cm/1¼ in slices. Separate the white part from the leaves and set aside. Sprinkle the cornflour over a large plate. Cut the tofu into 8–10 thin slices. Dust the tofu lightly on both sides with the cornflour.</li>
        
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the tofu for 1–1½ minutes on each side, or until crisp and lightly browned, turning carefully. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.</li>

        <li>Add the onion to the pan and cook over a medium-high heat for 6–8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for a few seconds more. Lift out of the pan with a slotted spoon or spatula and drain on kitchen paper.</li>

        <li>Add the broccoli, red pepper, carrot and white part of the pak choi to the frying pan and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add the noodles and green part of the pak choi and cook for 2 minutes more, or until the noodles are hot and the leaves have wilted.</li>

        <li>
            Stir the ketjap manis and half a teaspoon of chilli paste into the pan, add the tofu, onion and garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes more, stirring and tossing all the ingredients until hot. Add extra chilli to taste, scatter with the cashew nuts and serve.</li>
    </ol>
